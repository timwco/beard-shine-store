            |  Why Beard Shine?
          p.lead
            | It's rather a long story, but the short version is we were tired of paying high prices for high quality beard oil. We even tried one of those "beard clubs" until we realized what was in their products. Our goal is to make an organic, great smelling beard oil all while keeping the cost low.

            |  What's in your oil?
          p.lead
            | All of our oils start with a blend of 100% organic Jojoba & Sweet Almond Oil, both of which are proven to keep your beard healthy and protect and nourish the skin underneath. Also, our oil is never tested on animals and is only tested on bearded men, many who might look a bit like animals.
