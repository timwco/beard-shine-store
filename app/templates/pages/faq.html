We even tried one of those "beard clubs" until we realized what was in their products. Our goal is to make an organic, great smelling beard oil — all while keeping your cost low.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> What's in your oil?</h4><p class="lead">All of our oils start with a blend of 100% organic Jojoba & Sweet Almond Oils, both of which are proven to keep your beard healthy while protecting and nourishing the skin underneath. Also, our oil is never tested on animals and is only tested on bearded men, although many of them might look like animals.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> How long will a bottle last?</h4><p class="lead">Our bottles are all 1 oz. in size and should last an average-size beard 3–4 months, depending on usage.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> Problem with your order?</h4><p class="lead">First of all, we're sorry to hear that. Secondly, please email us at <a href="mailto:beardshineatl@gmail.com">beardshine@gmail.com </a> and we'll get back to you as soon as possible (usually in less than a day).</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> What can I do with your oil?</h4><p class="lead">Ok, you're an adult, you know what this is for. Please don't dump it in your eye or eat it. This is for external use on your beard and hair only. We are not responsible in the event of misuse.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> I might be allergic.</h4><p class="lead">For the record, that's a statement and not a question. However, if you're not sure if our product will work for you, please email us at <a href="mailto:beardshineatl@gmail.com">beardshine@gmail.com</a>, and we'll help in any way we can.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
