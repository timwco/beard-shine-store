We even tried one of those "beard clubs" until we realized what was in their products. Our goal is to make an organic, great smelling beard oil all while keeping the cost low.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q :</span> What's in your oil?</h4><p class="lead">All of our oils start with a blend of 100% organic Jojoba & Sweet Almond Oil, both of which are proven to keep your beard healthy and protect and nourish the skin underneath. Also, our oil is never tested on animals and is only tested on bearded men, many who might look a bit like animals.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q :</span> How long will a bottle last?</h4><p class="lead">Our bottles are all 1 oz in size and will last someone with an average sized beard 3-4 months.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q :</span> Problem with our order?</h4><p class="lead">First, we are sorry to hear that. Secondly, please email us at <a href="mailto:beardshineatl@gmail.com">beardshine@gmail </a>and we will get back to you as soon as possible, usually in less than a day.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
