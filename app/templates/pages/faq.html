We even tried one of those "beard clubs" until we found out was was in it. Alas, we set out with one simple goal, create a beard oil that is organic and smells great. That's it. Enjoy.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="about-box question-box"><h4><span>Q:</span> When will I get my order?</h4><p class="lead">We will notify you when your order ships and you'll receive a tracking number.
